            Greetings and thank you for checking out my personal portfolio page! My name is Nicholas Donato and I am a certified Full Stack Developer 
            from the University of Central Florida's Coding Bootcamp. In addition to obtaining my certificate in Full Stack Development from UCF, 
            I additionally am a 2014 graduate from Penn State University with a BA in Economics, during which time I also took multiple computer science 
            courses to expand my knowledge and critical thinking skills prior to my decision to become a developer. Prior to my recent training, I used my knowledge 
            of C++ and excel VBA to conduct statistical database modeling programs while working for a major brokerage firm
            on Wall Street in New York City.  During this time I also tested my at the time limited python skills to further 
            construct algorithmic data driven modeling programs for the VIX and S&P 500.  Since then I have expanded my skills and expertise into multiple areas
            which include: JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS, Express(.json), ReactJS, HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap, Materialize, Git(Version Control), 
            Responsive Design, API/JSON, PHP, RESTful API, Firebase, Heroku, MySQL + Workbench, MongoDB, AJAX, Sequelize
             SEO, Node Express, CRUD Operations, POSTMAN Angular, AngularJS and Database Modeling, Ruby On Rails 
             among others such as Python, C++, Java, R, C#.
        </p>
        <p>
           I am a determined Developer still learning every day.  Whether it is contstructing interactive websites from scratch or coding applications with API's and/or
           constructed databases I am versed with the logic and operations that goes into constructing something from scratch or applying changes to an existing program or application.  The most valuable 
           aspects of my training has been working together with team members to organize and divy out tasks in seperate parts to complete a final goal with proper communication and set up.
        </p>
